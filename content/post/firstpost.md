### Off-Season Gear Inspections

Welcome to most folks' off season. Time to inspect your gear. Tear your competition guns down, do a through inspection, and do any repairs that you need to. Gonna do any upgrades? Start planning them now, not when matches are a week away in the Spring.

Gonna do some more loading port work on my shotgun, and an overall inspection.

Check your round counts for periodic maintenance. Don't wait until something stops working mid-match to realize that your extractor spring is too weak.
